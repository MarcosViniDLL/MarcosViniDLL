## Hi 💪, I'm Vinícius!

🎓 I am a student of the Systems Development technical course at ETE Ariano Vilar Suassuna.

👨🏻‍💻 I am currently working in a group on developing an app. For now, we only have the high-fidelity prototype made in Figma, later we will start developing it.

**Fun Facts**

🌐 My first "Hello World" was in C++.

♨️ The next programming language that I want to learn is Java.

🎮 While I'm not coding or studying, I usually watch anime, movies or play games.
